# Day 3
## Event-Driven Programming
---------------------

Event-Driven:
- Event Dispatcher
    - Dispatches events into queue or callbacks

- Event Handler
    - Takes events and responds to the events with actions


*Thread:*
- Threads are similar to multiprocessing
- Run in parallel
- Shared data buffer
- Managed by scheduler run by the operating system


*Types of Threads:*
- Daemon Thread: automatically closes after other threads end
- Joined Thread: joining thread waits for joined thread to finish
